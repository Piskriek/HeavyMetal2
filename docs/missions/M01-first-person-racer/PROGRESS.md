# M01 · First-person racer — build log

Hand-off document for the overwatch AI (which cannot read this repository). Everything here is a
**fact measured in the checkout**, not a plan. Branch `arena/01a0d1d6-heavymetal2`.

## T0 — First-person spike + eye-level audit · **done, committed `0d755df`**

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `?fp=1` | Camera on the player's ball at eye height, FOV 74, near 4, far 60000, flag off by default (`firstPersonFlag` reads `location.search`) |
| Modules | `src/game/first-person.ts` (pure, `firstPersonFrame()`), `src/game/eye-level-audit.ts` (pure), `scripts/eye-level-audit.mjs`, `tests/{first-person,eye-level-audit}.test.ts` |
| Audit output | `docs/FP_SPIKE.md` — 787 samples every 200 spline units, 535 props (299 fixed planes, 91 camera-facing, 141 decals, 4 meshes); 200 fixed planes are seen edge-on within 3000 units; worst road-edge distance 271 (canyon 38500), decals within 400: 79 |
| Determinism / runtime | same report twice, ~1.4 s headless |
| Regression | `npm run check` 459 tests / 47 suites green, `tsc` clean, build 1,538.03 kB |
| **Open** | The human decision block at the bottom of `docs/FP_SPIKE.md` is still blank. **T3 is gated on it.** |

Preview: `npx vite --config vite.preview.config.ts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173`, open the printed URL
with `?fp=1` appended, start a Quick Race.

## T1 — Start pad, goblin push, slingshot retired · **done, committed `6b1d992`**

### What a run does now

1. `ready` — the field stands on the pad in grid lanes `[2, 0, 1, 3]` (`createRacers` unchanged).
2. `Enter` / `Space` / the on-screen button issue one `start` command → status `pushing`.
3. 48 fixed ticks (0.4 s): every racer gets `target_i = startPushVelocity(pace, seed, id)`,
   `vx = target·k/48`, `vy = vz = 0`, `z` locked, `grounded = true`. No obstacle is scanned.
4. Tick 48 → status `flying`; normal `stepRacer` continues and the hill does the rest.

### Measured (headless, every legacy loadout, seed `0x5eed`)

| Racer | Gate tick (x = 1184.44) | vx at gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RIVET | 226 | 832 |
| NIX | 225 | 1054 |
| GRUB | 234 | 727 |
| SPROCKET | 222 | 937 |

Budget was ≤ 600 ticks and 700–1100 u/s. No racer drops under 60 u/s for more than 12 ticks on the
run-in; `minVx > 40`. The first loop engages on every run.

### Numbers the next ticket needs

* `PUSH_TICKS 48`, `PUSH_BASE_VX 360`, `PUSH_SPREAD 0.04` (±2 %), `DEFAULT_PUSH_SEED 0x5eed`.
* `pushRampVx(target, 48) === target` exactly; `k` outside `1…48` throws `ContractError('E_PUSH_TICK')`.
* `START_DROP 240`, `START_PAD_END_X 430`, `START_DESCENT_END_X 1060`, `START_RUNIN_END_X 1370`,
  `START_Y = GROUND − START_DROP − RADIUS = 207`, max descent grade 0.570, `courseY(1370) = 478`
  (unchanged), `TRACK_DISTANCE 36000`, `FINISH 72190`.
* The landscape *dressing* still follows the ribbon, which was not re-sculpted: the first loop is
  3D at s ≈ 8 376 while the physics gate is engine x = 1 184.44. Closing that 163.5-unit visual gap
  is T3 dressing work, not T1.
* In push mode the 11 start-zone pieces (4 ramps, 4 boosts, sign, blimp, sheep) below the gate are
  removed from the layout; the remaining obstacles are byte-identical on all three courses
  (228 → 217 ridge, 241 → 230 boomtown/sheep).
* The slingshot code is intact: `startMode: 'sling'` restores the legacy envelope (that is the
  physics-parity fixture's path) and `aim`/`launch` are refused with `reason: 'sling_disabled'` in
  push mode. `CONTRACTS_VERSION = 2`.

### Verification

`npm run check` → **467 tests / 47 suites green** · `npx tsc --noEmit` clean · `npm run build` →
1,541.30 kB (420.71 kB gzip). New suites: `tests/start-push.test.ts` (4),
`tests/start-zone.test.ts` (4), `tests/contracts.test.ts` +1, all registered in `scripts/check.mjs`.

### Known gaps, deliberately left

* The starter goblin is **invisible**: `start()` is a real shove, but no pusher sprite/mesh appears
  yet (T4/T5 own the art). The player currently just starts rolling.
* No cockpit: `?fp=1` is the only first-person view, and it is the T0 spike (no yoke, no HUD frame).
* `stepRace` still has the legacy checkpoint at engine x ≥ 17000; T2 deletes it.
* The slingshot's 3D launcher prop is still dressed onto the pad.

## Next

* **T2** — first-loop merge: gate → pool → ready-up → ordered ghost release (depends on T1, unblocked).
* **T3** — first-person rig + gyro + cockpit, **gated on the T0 human verdict**.
